# CHANGELOG

## v4.0.1
Updated `StateLink` with `IntentLink` to better support custom desk structures. (thanks to @p10e)

## v4.0.0
**Breaking Change**
Implementing the desk structure now has to be done manually. 

## v3.1.0
Added the `fieldNames` option to change the names of the fields the plugin automatically injects.
At this time there is only 1 field you can change which is called `lang` (by default the value of this is `__i18n_lang`).
