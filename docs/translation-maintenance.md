The translation maintenance tab can be used to clean up and manage your Sanity data. It can help with the following operations:
1. Migrate from V4 to V5 by adjusting the document ID's
2. Fix documents who are missing the language field
3. Fix documents who are missing references to their translations
4. Clean up orphaned translations who are missing their base document
